### Transformations

The following transformations were applied to the data

* **Merge training and test datasets** (append one on to the end of the other)
* **Extract columns related to Mean and SD values** (via grep string matching)
* **Tidy variable names** (remove invalid characters)
* **Insert actual activity names** (replace index values with descriptive names)
* **Collate tidy data** (produce matrix of mean column value for each permutation of Activity & Subject)
